        <h1>CPNSimulator</h1>
        <p>CPNSimulator is an educational application for creation and simulation of coloured Petri nets.</p>
        <p>Coloured Petri nets (CPN) are graphical modelling language used e. g. to describe paralell and
        distributed systems or verify protocol. For further information about CPN,
        visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloured_Petri_net">this link</a>.</p>
        <p>This application was created as a part of Master's thesis on FIT BUT. Its goal is to
        substitute <a href="http://cpntools.org/">CPNTools</a> in the Petri nets courses.</p>
        <p>Application is composed from 3 basic parts - editor, simulator and state space analysis tool.
        Each part is described in one of the following chapters.</p>
        <p>The basic toolboxes and menus simply allow the user to save, load or create new net. Enabledness
        of other tools is specific to the given context.</p>
