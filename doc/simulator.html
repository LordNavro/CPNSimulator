        <h1>Simulator</h1>
        <p>Simulator allows the user to make net computations. Use the following actions to interact with the net:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Manually fire transition:</b> Select binding element from the combo box and click the Fire button.</li>
            <li><b>Move to initial marking:</b> Populate places using the initial marking inscriptions.</li>
            <li><b>Fire random transition:</b> Click this action to fire a random enabled transition with a
            random binding element.</li>
            <li><b>Fire multiple:</b> Input transition count and random transition will get fired.</li>
            <li><b>Drag items:</b> Drag items in case the net is not readable enough.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To return to edit mode, click the Edit net button.
        To proceed to analysis, click Analysis -> Generate state space.</p>
        <p>In case that any of the computation takes too long to execute or an endless loop is reached, you can manually
        terminate it using the Cancel button. If it was the Find binding action that you have terminated, you can
        recall it manually using the Find binding button. However, most of these cases are caused by errors in net
        design and return to Editor is suggested.</p>
